    "#### Answer:- Abstraction is one of the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) that enables us to represent complex real-world scenarios in simplified and abstracted manners. It allows us to focus on the essential features of an object, ignoring its non-essential or irrelevant details.\n",
    "#### In OOPs, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be inherited by other classes. They may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. Abstract methods are those methods that do not have any implementation and are only declared in the abstract class. They need to be implemented by the classes that inherit them.\n",
